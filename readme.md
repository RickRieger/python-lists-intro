# Intro to python lists exersize

1.	Write a function that has one parameter. When you call the function, you will be passing in a list of strings. 
a.	Print to the console the value at the 0 index of the list
b.	Return the value at the 0 index of the list
2.	Write a function that has one parameter. When you call the function, you will be passing in a list of strings that represent different colors -- create a list and append the following values into the list: “blue”, “red”, “white”, “green”, “yellow”
a.	Prompt the user to enter a color.
b.	Iterate over the list. If the user inputted color matches any of the colors in the list, print to the console “You found my chosen color!”
3.	Write a function that has one parameter. When you call the function, you will be passing in a list of numbers.
a.	Iterate over the list and add up all of the numbers inside of it
b.	If the sum of the numbers is even, return string “Even” from the function
c.	If the sum of the numbers is odd, return string “Odd” from the function
4.	Write a function that has two parameters. The first parameter will represent a list, the second parameter will represent a number.
a.	The list that is passed in needs to be a list of numbers
b.	Iterate over the list and print to the console each value in the list that is greater than the number parameter

Setup 
1.	Create a new PY file 
2.	Create Visual Studio Code launch.json file 

The following problems will focus on lists but will utilize other concepts you have learned up to this point, including functions, loops, conditionals, and variables.  

Example of creating a list, creating a function that takes in a single parameter, and calling the function while passing in a list: 
  



  
Lists and Functions
1.	Write a function that has one parameter: a list
a.	The list that is passed in needs to be a list of numbers
b.	Compute the average of the numbers inside the list
c.	Any numbers in the list that are less than the computed average will be appended into a separate list. That list will then be returned from the function.
2.	Write a function that has two parameters: a list, a number
a.	Return the value in the list at the index represented by the number parameter
b.	If there is no value at the specified index, print to the console “No value here!”
3.	Write a function that has one parameter: a list
a.	The list that is passed in needs to be a list of numbers
b.	Find the most frequent value in the list and return that value
4.	Write a function that has two parameters: a list, a list
a.	Both lists that are passed in should contain the first names of people
b.	Iterate over the lists comparing the values at each index from one list to the other. If there is a matching name in both lists, return that name from the function
c.	For example: [“Nevin”, “David”, “Mike”] and [“Brett”, “Mike”, “Charles]
i.	“Mike” would be returned from the function because it is a match in both lists
